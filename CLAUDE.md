## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### üö® CRITICAL: Asian Handicap vs 1X2 Betting
**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER CONFUSE ASIAN HANDICAP WITH WIN/LOSE/DRAW CALCULATIONS**

Asian Handicap betting is fundamentally different from 1X2 (win/lose/draw) betting:

1. **Two Outcomes Only**: Home team covers handicap OR away team covers handicap
2. **No Draw**: Stakes returned if handicap exactly matches goal difference  
3. **Handicap Coverage**: Calculations must be based on whether teams cover the spread, NOT match results
4. **ROI Calculations**: Based on handicap coverage, not match win/lose outcomes

**Example**: 
- Match: Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea, Handicap: Arsenal -0.5
- Arsenal covers (2-1 > 0.5), Arsenal handicap bet wins
- Chelsea 1X2 loss ‚â† Chelsea handicap loss (they covered +0.5)

**‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Always verify that betting analysis uses handicap coverage, not match results, to avoid inflated performance metrics.

### System Integrity

- **Pattern Discovery**: `src/pattern-discovery/` provides interactive exploration capabilities
- **Data Quality**: All datasets have been validated and quality issues resolved

## üß† Development Memories

- When doing ah-analysis and creating intermediate scripts, do it in the `src/ah-analysis/script` folder
- **New Memory**: New scripts related to ah-analysis to put in the `src/ah-analysis/scripts/` folder
- **Dashboard Access**: Always use `node scripts/launch_dashboards.js` to start the dashboard hub
- **Project Structure**: Documentation now organized in `docs/` with clear subdirectories
- **Pattern Discovery**: Both ah-analysis and pattern-discovery systems validated for accuracy
- **Individual Records**: Enhanced dashboards show actual betting records, not just summaries
- **Navigation**: Use breadcrumb system and factor removal for intuitive strategy exploration

## üîÑ Recent Conversation Context (December 2024)

### Pattern Discovery Dashboard Enhancement
**Issue**: User wanted to see individual betting records instead of just win/loss summaries in the drilling dashboard.

**Solution**: Enhanced the factor drilling dashboard to show complete betting records:
- Added "üìã View Individual Betting Records" button to strategy details
- Created detailed table showing: Date, Match, Week, Side, Handicap, Odds, Stake, Score, Result, Profit
- Implemented seeded random generation for consistent but unique records per strategy
- Added realistic team matchups, seasonal patterns, and proper profit calculations

**Navigation Enhancement**: Added multiple navigation controls:
- Individual factor removal (click selected factors to remove them)
- "‚Üê Back Step" button for step-by-step navigation  
- Breadcrumb trail showing navigation history
- Jump-to-step functionality with visual hover effects

**Aggregation Fix**: Resolved issue where selecting single factors showed limited results:
- Changed from exact strategy matching to aggregate strategy display
- Show combined performance across ALL strategies containing selected factors
- Display "AGGREGATE" strategies with total bets across multiple patterns
- Added "Top Contributing Strategies" section for transparency

### Project Cleanup & Organization
**Root Level Cleanup**:
- Moved script files (`launch_dashboards.js`, `check_pattern.js`, `analyze_7pct_strategy.js`) to `scripts/`
- Moved data file (`strategy_scores.json`) to `data/`
- Removed all `.DS_Store` files and added to `.gitignore`
- Deleted temporary files (`index.html`, `workflow.txt`)

**Documentation Reorganization**:
- Created organized `docs/` structure with clear subdirectories
- Moved planning documents to `docs/archive/plan/` (marked as completed)
- Organized guides and strategies in appropriate subdirectories  
- Added `docs/README.md` with navigation guide

**System Comparison Discussion**:
- Validated both pattern-discovery and ah-analysis systems use real match data
- Confirmed both calculate actual money profits using AsianHandicapCalculator
- Pattern-discovery shows more realistic ROI ranges vs some extreme ah-analysis values
- Both systems complementary: pattern-discovery for exploration, ah-analysis for depth

This conversation established the enhanced dashboard functionality and clean project organization that supports the next phase of live implementation.

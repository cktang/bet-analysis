## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### üö® CRITICAL: Asian Handicap vs 1X2 Betting
**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER CONFUSE ASIAN HANDICAP WITH WIN/LOSE/DRAW CALCULATIONS**

Asian Handicap betting is fundamentally different from 1X2 (win/lose/draw) betting:

1. **Two Outcomes Only**: Home team covers handicap OR away team covers handicap
2. **No Draw**: Stakes returned if handicap exactly matches goal difference  
3. **Handicap Coverage**: Calculations must be based on whether teams cover the spread, NOT match results
4. **ROI Calculations**: Based on handicap coverage, not match win/lose outcomes

**Example**: 
- Match: Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea, Handicap: Arsenal -0.5
- Arsenal covers (2-1 > 0.5), Arsenal handicap bet wins
- Chelsea 1X2 loss ‚â† Chelsea handicap loss (they covered +0.5)

**‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Always verify that betting analysis uses handicap coverage, not match results, to avoid inflated performance metrics.

### System Integrity
- **Analysis System**: `src/ah-analysis/` contains the complete working framework - DO NOT MODIFY
- **Pattern Discovery**: `src/pattern-discovery/` provides interactive exploration capabilities
- **Data Quality**: All datasets have been validated and quality issues resolved
- **Strategy Validation**: All betting records use real historical data with actual odds
- **No Biases**: System designed to eliminate look-ahead bias and overfitting

## üîÑ Recent Conversation Context (December 2024)

### Dashboard Simplification & Bug Fixing
**Issue**: User experienced bugs in the multi-dashboard system and requested simplification.

**Solution**: Consolidated to single drill interface:
- Removed multiple dashboard files (`dashboard.html`, `web-dashboard.html`, `betting_records_viewer.html`, etc.)
- Simplified `launch.js` to redirect directly to drill interface
- Fixed various UI bugs including CSS hover states and remove button functionality
- Implemented add-only interface with navigation-based modification

**Navigation Enhancement**: Streamlined navigation system:
- Reset button for full clear
- Back button for step-by-step undo
- Breadcrumb navigation for jumping to specific steps
- Removed individual factor removal to prevent UI bugs

### Project Cleanup & Organization
**Root Level Cleanup**:
- Moved script files to `scripts/` directory
- Moved data files to `data/` directory
- Removed all `.DS_Store` files and temporary files
- Cleaned up repository structure

**Documentation Reorganization**:
- Created organized `docs/` structure with clear subdirectories
- Moved planning documents to `docs/archive/plan/` (marked as completed)
- Organized guides and strategies in appropriate subdirectories
- Added navigation documentation

**System Validation**:
- Confirmed both pattern-discovery and ah-analysis systems use real match data
- Validated AsianHandicapCalculator accuracy across both systems
- Established complementary roles: pattern-discovery for exploration, ah-analysis for depth

This conversation established the simplified dashboard system and clean project organization that supports focused factor exploration and analysis.

# FBRef Incident Data Integration Summary

## ✅ **Successfully Integrated FBRef Incident Data**

### **🎯 What Was Accomplished**

1. **✅ Enhanced Data Processing Script Updated**
   - Modified `src/scripts/enhance-asian-handicap.js` to load and integrate FBRef incident data
   - Added intelligent team name matching to link incident data with processed matches
   - Version upgraded from 1.0 to 2.0

2. **✅ New FBRef-Based Metrics Added**
   - **Match Cleanliness**: Clean vs incident-heavy matches (0 = cleanest)
   - **Card Discipline**: Yellow/red card tracking per team
   - **Penalty Impact**: Penalty statistics and conversion rates
   - **Goal Timing**: First/second half, early/late goal analysis
   - **Substitution Patterns**: Team substitution strategies and timing
   - **Incident Density**: Total incidents per minute of play
   - **Match Intensity**: Combined score based on cards, goals, and xG

### **📊 Integration Results**

**Data Coverage:**
- **2022-2023**: 106/380 matches (28%) with incident data
- **2023-2024**: 80/373 matches (21%) with incident data  
- **2024-2025**: 112/373 matches (30%) with incident data
- **Total**: 298/1126 matches (26%) enhanced with FBRef incidents

**Enhanced File Sizes:**
- Enhanced files are similar size to processed files (some slightly smaller due to compression)
- All 1,126 matches successfully enhanced with new metrics
- 298 matches include detailed incident analysis

### **🧠 Smart Team Name Matching**

The integration includes intelligent team name normalization:
- `Manchester United` → `Manchester Utd`
- `Newcastle United` → `Newcastle Utd` 
- `Wolverhampton Wanderers` → `Wolverhampton`
- `Brighton & Hove Albion` → `Brighton`
- Multiple fallback matching strategies for maximum coverage

### **📈 Enhanced Analysis Capabilities**

**New analytical possibilities:**
1. **Clean Match Filtering**: Identify matches without controversial incidents
2. **Card Pattern Analysis**: Team discipline and referee strictness
3. **Goal Timing Strategies**: Early vs late goal impact on outcomes
4. **Substitution Impact**: Manager tactical changes and their effects
5. **Match Intensity Scoring**: Objective measure of match excitement/chaos
6. **Penalty Analysis**: Spot kick frequency and conversion rates

### **🎯 Usage Examples**

**Access enhanced data:**
```bash
# View enhanced data with incidents
cat data/enhanced/year-2024-2025-enhanced.json

# Count matches with incident data
grep -c '"fbrefIncidents"' data/enhanced/year-2024-2025-enhanced.json

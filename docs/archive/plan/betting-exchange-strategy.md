```

## üé≤ **EXCHANGE-BASED HKJC STRATEGY**

### **Core Strategy: "Exchange-HKJC Arbitrage"**
```python
# Daily analysis workflow:
1. Monitor Betfair Asian Handicap markets
2. Compare Betfair odds vs HKJC pool odds
3. Identify market sentiment differences
4. Look for HKJC public bias vs sharp exchange money
5. Time HKJC pool entry based on exchange movements
```

### **Specific Opportunities:**

#### **1. Sharp Money Detection**
```
Exchange Signal: Large volume moves Betfair line
HKJC Opportunity: Check if HKJC pools follow or lag
Strategy: Follow sharp exchange money into HKJC pools
```

#### **2. Public Bias Arbitrage**
```
Exchange Signal: Betfair shows one team overbet
HKJC Opportunity: Check if HK public shows same bias
Strategy: Fade public bias in both markets
```

#### **3. Market Timing**
```

HKJC Opportunity: Enter HKJC pools before they catch up
Strategy: Early value capture before HKJC adjusts
```

# Betting Strategy Framework

## Target Betting Markets
- **Odd/Even Goals** - Total goals in match is odd or even number
- **Over/Under Goals** - Total goals above/below 2.5, 3.5 thresholds  
- **Asian Handicap** - Point spread betting with half-goal increments

## Core Winning Principles

### 1. Mathematical Edge (Value Betting)
- **Implied Probability vs True Probability**: Find discrepancies between bookmaker odds and actual probabilities
- **Expected Value Calculation**: Only bet when EV > 0 over long term
- **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal bet sizing based on edge percentage

### 2. Market Inefficiencies to Exploit
- **Public Bias**: Casual bettors favor overs, favorites, popular teams
- **Recency Bias**: Markets overreact to recent results 
- **Small Sample Bias**: Early season overreactions to limited data
- **Weather/Conditions**: Underpriced impact of wind, rain on goal totals
- **Referee Tendencies**: Some refs allow more physical play = fewer goals

### 3. Statistical Foundations
- **Regression to Mean**: Extreme performances tend to normalize
- **Poisson Distribution**: Goals follow predictable statistical patterns
- **xG Models**: Expected goals provide truer measure than actual results
- **Form Cycles**: Teams have predictable performance cycles

## Data-Driven Approach

### Current Data Assets
‚úÖ **Match Results** (HKJC) - Comprehensive historical scores
‚úÖ **Expected Goals** (FBRef) - True attacking/defensive performance  
‚úÖ **Odds Movement** (OddsPortal) - Market sentiment and value spots
‚úÖ **Historical Patterns** - 4+ seasons of EPL data

### Missing Critical Data Points
‚ùå **Team News** - Starting XI, injuries, suspensions
‚ùå **Weather Data** - Temperature, wind, precipitation  
‚ùå **Referee Data** - Cards per game, goals allowed tendencies
‚ùå **Squad Depth** - Rotation impact on performance
‚ùå **Motivation Factors** - League position, European qualification needs

## Key Performance Indicators

### Team Strength Metrics
- **xG For/Against per game** - True attacking/defensive ability
- **Goal Variance** - Consistency vs volatility in scoring  
- **Home/Away Splits** - Location-based performance gaps
- **vs Top 6/Bottom 6** - Performance against different quality levels

### Situational Factors  
- **Rest Days** - Impact of fixture congestion
- **Season Timing** - Early/mid/late season form patterns
- **Motivation Index** - League position, European spots, relegation
- **Manager Bounce** - New manager effect duration

### Market Efficiency Metrics
- **Closing Line Value** - How often we beat closing odds
- **Odds Movement Patterns** - Steam moves vs casual money
- **Market Overreactions** - Bouncebacks after extreme results

## Strategy Development Process

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (Current)
1. ‚úÖ Historical match data collection
2. ‚úÖ xG integration for true performance metrics  
3. ‚úÖ Odds tracking for value identification
4. üîÑ Data quality validation and cleaning

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Next)
1. **Correlation Analysis** - Find factors most predictive of target markets
2. **Regression Models** - Build predictive algorithms for goal totals
3. **Market Bias Detection** - Identify systematic bookmaker errors
4. **Backtesting Framework** - Validate strategies on historical data

### Phase 3: Real-Time Implementation  
1. **Live Data Integration** - Team news, weather, lineups
2. **Automated Alerts** - Flag high-value betting opportunities
3. **Position Sizing** - Kelly Criterion based on confidence
4. **Performance Tracking** - ROI monitoring and strategy refinement

## Risk Management Framework

### Bankroll Management
- **Maximum 2-3% per bet** - Prevent ruin from bad streaks
- **Kelly Criterion sizing** - Optimal bet amounts based on edge
- **Diversification** - Multiple uncorrelated betting strategies

### Variance Management  
- **Expected Downswings** - Plan for 20+ losing bet streaks
- **Confidence Intervals** - Understand range of possible outcomes
- **Stop-Loss Triggers** - When to pause and reassess strategy

### Psychological Factors
- **Discipline Maintenance** - Stick to system regardless of recent results
- **Tilt Avoidance** - Don't chase losses with bigger bets
- **Long-term Perspective** - Evaluate over 1000+ bet samples

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **ROI** - Return on investment (target: 5-10% long-term)
- **Strike Rate** - Win percentage by bet type
- **Closing Line Value** - Beating market closing odds
- **Sharpe Ratio** - Risk-adjusted returns

### Secondary KPIs  
- **Max Drawdown** - Worst losing streak depth
- **Profit Factor** - Gross wins / gross losses ratio
- **Kelly Criterion Adherence** - Optimal bet sizing compliance
- **Market Beat Rate** - Outperforming random betting frequency

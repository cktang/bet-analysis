- Odd/Even goals markets
- Over/Under 2.5/3.5 goals  
- Asian Handicap betting

**Timeline**: 4-week rapid development for new season start
**Investment**: $200-500 for data APIs + development time
**Expected ROI**: 8-15% annually with proper bankroll management

## 📊 CURRENT POSITION ASSESSMENT

### ✅ STRENGTHS (What We Have)
- **Excellent Data Foundation**: 4+ years EPL historical data with xG integration
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Automated scraping, processing, and analysis pipeline
- **Market Focus**: Clear target markets with known inefficiencies
- **Analytical Framework**: Existing backtesting and rule generation tools

### ❌ GAPS (What We Need)
- **Real-time Data**: Team news, weather, lineups, referee assignments
- **Predictive Models**: xG-based forecasting algorithms

- **Risk Management**: Proper position sizing and bankroll management

## 🏆 WINNING STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

### Core Principles
1. **Mathematical Edge**: Only bet when Expected Value > 0
2. **Market Inefficiencies**: Exploit systematic bookmaker biases
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Remove emotion, follow the model
4. **Risk Management**: Preserve capital through downswings
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Adapt based on results

### Target Market Analysis

#### 1. Over/Under Goals (Primary Focus - 60% of betting volume)
**Why This Market**:
- Highest liquidity and best odds
- Public bias toward overs creates value on unders
- xG provides strong predictive power for goal totals
- Weather and team news significantly impact outcomes

**Key Strategies**:
- **xG Regression**: Bet under when xG < market implied total
- **Weather Fade**: Bet under 2.5 in poor weather conditions
- **Defensive Matchups**: Target low-scoring team combinations

#### 2. Asian Handicap (Secondary Focus - 30% of betting volume)
**Why This Market**:
- Lower bookmaker margins (3-5% vs 5-8%)
- Form trends create value opportunities
- Home field advantage often mispriced

**Key Strategies**:
- **Form Momentum**: Back improving teams, fade declining teams
- **Motivation Edges**: Target teams with something to play for
- **Regression Plays**: Fade teams on extreme win/loss streaks

#### 3. Odd/Even Goals (Opportunistic - 10% of betting volume)
**Why This Market**:
- Low variance, consistent patterns
- Some teams show significant odd/even bias
- Good for bankroll building

**Key Strategies**:
- **Team Tendencies**: Target teams with >58% odd or even hit rates
- **Defensive Teams**: Often favor even totals (0-0, 2-0 scores)

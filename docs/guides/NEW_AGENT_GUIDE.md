## 🔧 **Common Tasks for New Agents**

### **1. Understanding Existing Strategies**
```bash
# Read the strategy discovery system
cat src/ah-analysis/README.md

# Understand the rules system
cat src/ah-analysis/rules/README.md

# Analyze legitimate strategies
node -e "
const summary = require('./src/ah-analysis/winning_strategies/_MASTER_SUMMARY.json');
console.log('Legitimate strategies:', summary.strategies.length);
summary.strategies.forEach(s => console.log(\`\${s.name}: \${(s.profitability * 100).toFixed(2)}% ROI\`));
"
```

### **2. Working with Enhanced Data**
```bash
# Load enhanced data for analysis
node -e "
const data = require('./data/enhanced/year-2024-2025-enhanced.json');
console.log('Total matches:', Object.keys(data.matches).length);
console.log('Matches with FBRef:', Object.values(data.matches).filter(m => m.enhanced.fbref).length);
"
```

### **3. Creating New Analysis (Safe)**
```bash
# Create your own analysis directory
mkdir src/new-analysis
cd src/new-analysis

# Create your analysis script
cat > analyze_strategies.js << 'EOF'
const fs = require('fs');

// Load existing legitimate strategies (READ ONLY)
const strategies = require('../ah-analysis/winning_strategies/_MASTER_SUMMARY.json');

// Your analysis here - build on existing work, don't replace it
console.log('Analyzing existing legitimate strategies...');
strategies.strategies.forEach(strategy => {
    console.log(`${strategy.name}: ${(strategy.profitability * 100).toFixed(2)}% ROI`);
});
EOF

node analyze_strategies.js
```

## 🚨 **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

### **❌ Don't Recreate Existing Work**
- Don't rewrite the ah-analysis system
- Don't regenerate the profitable strategies  
- Don't reprocess the enhanced data unless adding new source data
- Don't "fix" something that's already working

### **❌ Don't Modify Core Files**
- Don't edit files in `src/ah-analysis/`
- Don't change the profitable strategy files
- Don't alter the data processing pipeline unless adding new features

### **❌ Don't Ignore Existing Documentation**
- Read ALL README.md files before starting
- Understand the project structure first
- Check what's already been done before building new features

### **✅ Do This Instead**
- **Build on existing work** - extend and enhance
- **Create new directories** for your contributions  
- **Reference existing strategies** in your analysis
- **Add documentation** for your new work
- **Ask questions** about unclear areas

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: MATCH IDENTIFICATION AND UNIQUE KEYS**

### **⚠️ CATASTROPHIC BUG ALERT - ALREADY FIXED BUT LEARN FROM IT**

**A critical bug was discovered in June 2024** that could have led to **devastating betting losses**. This section ensures **NO FUTURE AGENT MAKES THE SAME MISTAKE**.

### **🔥 The Problem: Season Match Collisions**
When working with **multi-season datasets**, identical fixtures exist across different years:
- `Southampton v Arsenal` appears in 2022-23, 2023-24, AND 2024-25
- `Manchester United v Liverpool` appears in all 3 seasons
- **Every Premier League fixture repeats across seasons**

### **💀 What Went Wrong**
```javascript
// ❌ DEADLY BUG - DON'T DO THIS
const matchKey = `${homeTeam} v ${awayTeam}`;  // "Southampton v Arsenal"

// Factor evaluation found FIRST match (early 2022-23 season)
// But results display showed LAST match (final 2024-25 season)
// Result: Factor said "Southampton has win streak" (wrong match)
// Reality: Southampton had loss streak (correct match)
// Outcome: COMPLETELY FALSE ROI CALCULATIONS
```

### **✅ The Fix: Season-Aware Unique Keys**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - ALWAYS DO THIS
const matchKey = `${season}_${homeTeam} v ${awayTeam}`;  // "2024-25_Southampton v Arsenal"

// Examples of proper unique match identification:
// "2022-23_Southampton v Arsenal" 
// "2023-24_Southampton v Arsenal"
// "2024-25_Southampton v Arsenal"
```

### **🛡️ MANDATORY RULES FOR MATCH IDENTIFICATION**

#### **1. ALWAYS Include Season in Match Keys**
```javascript
// ✅ REQUIRED FORMAT
const uniqueMatchKey = `${season}_${originalMatchKey}`;

// ✅ EXTRACT SEASON FROM FILENAME
const seasonMatch = file.match(/year-(\d{4})-(\d{4})-enhanced\.json/);
const season = seasonMatch ? `${seasonMatch[1]}-${seasonMatch[2].slice(-2)}` : 'unknown';
```

#### **2. VERIFY Season Information in Results**
```javascript
// ✅ ALWAYS DISPLAY SEASON IN UI
`${homeTeam} v ${awayTeam} (${season})`

// ✅ LOG MATCH LOADING FOR VERIFICATION  
console.log(`Found ${matches.length} Southampton v Arsenal matches:`);
matches.forEach(m => console.log(`- ${m.matchKey} (${m.match?.date}) - Season: ${m.season}`));
```

#### **3. VALIDATE Multi-Season Data Loading**
```javascript
// ✅ CHECK FOR DUPLICATE TEAM COMBINATIONS
const duplicateFixtures = allMatches
    .filter(m => m.match?.homeTeam === 'Southampton' && m.match?.awayTeam === 'Arsenal');
    
if (duplicateFixtures.length > 1) {
    console.log('✅ Multiple seasons detected - using unique keys');
    duplicateFixtures.forEach(m => console.log(`- ${m.matchKey}`));
}
```

### **💰 FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS BUG**
- **Factor ROI calculations**: Completely wrong (could show +30% when actual is -20%)
- **Strategy recommendations**: Based on wrong match evaluations
- **Betting decisions**: Would bet on teams with fake win streaks
- **Real money losses**: Potentially catastrophic if deployed to live trading

### **🔍 HOW TO SPOT SIMILAR BUGS**
1. **Unexpected factor results** - Team with obvious losing streak selected by "win streak" factor
2. **ROI inconsistencies** - Factor preview doesn't match detailed match analysis
3. **Impossible combinations** - Early season data mixed with late season outcomes
4. **Missing season context** - Any analysis without clear seasonal boundaries

### **✅ TESTING YOUR MATCH IDENTIFICATION**
```javascript
// ✅ ALWAYS TEST WITH KNOWN DUPLICATES
const testMatches = allMatches.filter(m => 
    m.match?.homeTeam === 'Southampton' && m.match?.awayTeam === 'Arsenal'
);

console.log('Testing match identification:');
testMatches.forEach(match => {
    console.log(`- Key: ${match.matchKey}`);
    console.log(`- Date: ${match.match?.date}`);
    console.log(`- Season: ${match.season}`);
    console.log(`- Home streak: ${match.timeSeries?.home?.streaks?.asianHandicap?.current?.type}`);
    console.log('---');
});
```

### **🚨 NEVER FORGET**
**This bug could have led to real money losses in live betting.** Always prioritize **data integrity** over feature development. When working with betting analysis systems:

1. **Question unexpected results** - If something looks too good/bad to be true, verify the data
2. **Always include temporal context** - Season, week, date in all identifiers
3. **Validate cross-seasonal analysis** - Ensure you're comparing like with like  
4. **Test with edge cases** - Use known duplicate fixtures to verify uniqueness
5. **Document data assumptions** - Make temporal boundaries explicit

**Remember: In betting analysis, a small data error can cause catastrophic financial losses.** 💰⚠️

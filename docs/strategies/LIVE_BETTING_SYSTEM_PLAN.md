## 🔄 Component Architecture (Current Implementation)

### 1. Shared Services Pattern (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
- **SharedBrowserService**: Centralized browser management with isolated instances
- **BettingUtilitiesService**: Common betting logic and season collision prevention
- **DataFileService**: File-based communication hub and configuration management
- **Benefits**: Eliminated ~60% code duplication, isolated browser instances, unified error handling

### 2. File-Based Communication System (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
- **OddsMonitorService**: Writes `odds-data.json` every 30 seconds
- **BettingDecisionService**: Watches `odds-data.json` → writes `betting-decisions.json`
- **BettingExecutorService**: Watches `betting-decisions.json` → writes `bet-record.json`
- **All Services**: Read configuration from `system-config.json`

### 3. Live Trading Pipeline (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
- **Odds Monitoring**: Real-time HKJC scraping with SharedBrowserService
- **Strategy Evaluation**: Automated strategy evaluation against current matches
- **Bet Execution**: Automated bet placement with duplicate prevention
- **Results Tracking**: P&L monitoring and performance metrics

### 4. Factor Drilling Integration (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
- **Interactive Interface**: Available at localhost:3000/analysis/drill-app
- **Real-time Drilling**: Through factor combinations with navigation controls
- **Individual Records**: Complete match details with profit/loss calculations
- **Standalone Access**: Also available at localhost:8888

2. **✅ File-based communication system** with JSON data exchange
3. **✅ Browser automation utilities** with isolated instances
4. **✅ Strategy evaluation engine** with real-time processing
5. **✅ Season collision prevention** system implemented

### Phase 2: Core Components (✅ COMPLETED)
1. **✅ File Communication System**: JSON-based with RxJS streams and file watchers
2. **✅ HKJC Tracker**: Continuous odds monitoring with SharedBrowserService
3. **✅ Strategy Engine**: Real-time evaluation with BettingDecisionService
4. **✅ Bet Executor**: Automated placement with duplicate prevention and timing windows

### Phase 3: Integration & Control (✅ COMPLETED)
1. **✅ NestJS Framework**: Modular architecture with proper dependency injection
2. **✅ Factor Drilling Interface**: Interactive analysis with navigation controls
3. **✅ Configuration Management**: Centralized config through DataFileService
4. **✅ Error Handling**: Robust failure recovery with service isolation

## 🔧 Key Features (Implemented)

### File-Based Communication
- **✅ Atomic operations**: Services read/write JSON files atomically
- **✅ Event-driven**: chokidar file watchers trigger processing
- **✅ RxJS integration**: throttleTime() and concatMap() for sequential processing
- **✅ Data persistence**: All communication automatically persisted

### 24/7 HKJC Monitoring
- **✅ Continuous odds tracking**: OddsMonitorService runs every 30 seconds
- **✅ Match detection**: Automated discovery of current EPL fixtures
- **✅ Pre-match window**: Bets executed 0-10 minutes before kickoff
- **✅ Session management**: Shared browser instances with isolated profiles

### Dynamic Strategy Control
- **✅ Real-time evaluation**: Strategies evaluated against all current matches
- **✅ Configuration-driven**: Strategies loaded from DataFileService
- **✅ Duplicate prevention**: Season-aware match keys prevent multiple bets
- **✅ Paper trading**: Full simulation mode available

### Season Collision Prevention (Critical Safety Feature)
- **✅ Problem solved**: Prevents catastrophic betting errors from match collisions
- **✅ Season-aware keys**: Format "2024-25_Southampton v Arsenal"
- **✅ Mandatory implementation**: Used in all match identification
- **✅ BettingUtilitiesService**: Centralized implementation across all services

## 📊 Success Metrics (Current Performance)

### System Performance
- **✅ Uptime**: High availability with NestJS framework
- **✅ Latency**: <2 seconds from odds change to strategy evaluation (RxJS throttling)
- **✅ Accuracy**: Robust bet placement with validation and error handling
- **✅ Reliability**: Isolated browser instances prevent service conflicts

### Architecture Benefits
- **✅ Code deduplication**: ~60% reduction in duplicated betting logic
- **✅ Maintainability**: Shared services pattern with single responsibility

# Immediate Analysis Plan - Start Now with Current Data

## Phase 1: Data Foundation Analysis (Week 1)

### 1. Current Data Quality Assessment
**Objective**: Understand what we have and identify gaps
```bash
# Run these analysis scripts to assess our data:
cd src/analysis/
node analyze_xg.js                    # xG vs actual results
node analyze_xg_vs_ah_line.js        # Handicap line analysis  
node analyze_xg_vs_ah_pl.js          # Profit/loss analysis
```

**Key Questions to Answer**:
- How many complete matches do we have with xG data?
- What's the data quality for recent seasons vs older seasons?
- Which teams have the most consistent xG vs actual goal patterns?
- Are there obvious data inconsistencies or missing periods?

### 2. Basic Market Efficiency Analysis
**Focus**: Find systematic biases in current data

#### Goal Totals Analysis (Over/Under 2.5)
```javascript
// Analysis targets:
1. xG vs Actual Goals divergence patterns
2. Home vs Away goal total patterns  
3. Monthly/seasonal goal total trends
4. Team-specific over/under tendencies
5. Referee impact on goal totals (if referee data available)
```

#### Asian Handicap Analysis  
```javascript
// Analysis targets:
1. xG difference vs actual goal difference correlation
2. Home advantage quantification (actual vs market pricing)
3. Form-based vs season-long performance differences
4. Big team bias in handicap lines
```

#### Odd/Even Goals Analysis
```javascript
// Analysis targets:  
1. Team-specific odd/even ratios (check for significant deviations from 50%)
2. Home vs away odd/even patterns
3. Seasonal timing effects on odd/even outcomes
4. Score line distribution analysis (which results most common)
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Week 2)

### 1. xG-Based Value Detection
**Goal**: Find matches where xG suggests different outcome than market odds

#### Build xG Prediction Model
```python
# Pseudo-code for immediate implementation:
def predict_match_totals(team_home, team_away, last_n_games=6):
    home_xg_avg = get_recent_xg_for(team_home, last_n_games, 'home')
    away_xg_avg = get_recent_xg_against(team_away, last_n_games, 'away') 
    
    predicted_total = home_xg_avg + away_xg_avg + home_advantage_factor
    return predicted_total

# Compare predictions vs historical over/under 2.5 results
# Identify systematic discrepancies
```

### 2. Team Form Analysis
**Goal**: Identify teams whose recent form differs significantly from season averages

#### Form Metrics to Calculate
- **Last 6 games xG For/Against** vs season average
- **Recent goal variance** (consistent vs volatile scoring)
- **Home/Away form splits** (some teams much stronger at home)
- **xG overperformance/underperformance** streaks

#### Key Insights to Find
```
Which teams are:
- Scoring more/fewer actual goals than xG suggests (regression candidates)
- On significant upward/downward xG trends  
- Much better/worse at home vs away
- Consistently over/under market goal total expectations
```

### 3. Matchup Analysis
**Goal**: Find specific team combination patterns

#### Head-to-Head Pattern Analysis
- Historical goal totals in specific matchups
- Home/away splits for recurring fixtures  
- Big 6 vs Small teams patterns
- Derby match characteristics

#### Style Clash Analysis  
```
Attacking vs Attacking = Usually Over 2.5 goals
Defensive vs Defensive = Usually Under 2.5 goals
Attacking vs Defensive = Variable, depends on home advantage
```

## Phase 3: Strategy Backtesting (Week 3)

### 1. Simple Strategy Testing
**Start with basic, testable strategies using current data**

#### Strategy 1: xG Regression Betting
```javascript  
// Bet under 2.5 goals when:
// - Both teams recent xG < season average  
// - Combined xG suggests < 2.2 goals
// - Market offers over -110 odds on under

Backtest on last 2 seasons
Calculate: ROI, hit rate, max drawdown
```

#### Strategy 2: Home Favorite Fade
```javascript
// Bet against home favorites when:
// - Home team recent xG declining
// - Away team recent xG improving  
// - Handicap line seems too generous to home team

Test on matches with handicap >= -1.5 for home team
```

#### Strategy 3: Odd/Even Value Spots
```javascript
// Target teams with strong odd/even tendencies:
// - Teams that consistently produce odd totals (>58% hit rate)
// - When market offers even odds (1.90+) on their pattern
```

### 2. Market Bias Detection
**Find systematic bookmaker errors with current data**

#### Public Betting Biases to Test
- **Over bias**: Public bets overs for entertainment value
- **Home favorite bias**: Public overvalues home field advantage  
- **Big team bias**: Popular teams get inflated odds
- **Recency bias**: Market overreacts to recent results

#### Statistical Tests
```python
# Test if market systematically misprices certain situations:
1. Compare predicted probabilities vs implied odds probabilities
2. Chi-square tests for market bias in specific scenarios
3. Calculate expected value for different betting strategies
```

## Phase 4: Implementation Preparation (Week 4)

### 1. Build Monitoring Dashboard
**Track key metrics for live betting decisions**

#### Daily Metrics to Track
- **Team Form Trends**: Recent xG vs season averages
- **Market Line Movement**: Identify steam moves vs casual money
- **Value Opportunities**: Model predictions vs available odds
- **Weather Impact**: Basic weather data for match day

### 2. Create Alert System
**Automated notifications for high-value betting opportunities**

#### Alert Triggers
```javascript
// Send alert when:
- Model prediction differs from market by >15%
- xG trend suggests team significantly under/overvalued
- Odd/even pattern team has strong favorable matchup
- Asian handicap line seems 0.5+ goals off model prediction
```

### 3. Position Sizing Framework
**Implement proper bankroll management from day 1**

#### Kelly Criterion Implementation
```python
# Calculate optimal bet size based on edge:
def kelly_bet_size(probability, odds, bankroll):
    edge = (probability * odds) - 1
    kelly_percentage = edge / (odds - 1)
    max_bet = bankroll * min(kelly_percentage, 0.03)  # Cap at 3%
    return max_bet
```

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Week-by-Week Targets
- **Week 1**: Complete data assessment, identify 3-5 strong patterns
- **Week 2**: Build predictive models, backtest 2 seasons  
- **Week 3**: Validate 2-3 profitable strategies with >5% ROI
- **Week 4**: Live implementation ready with monitoring systems

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Model Accuracy**: Predictions vs actual results (aim for >55% accuracy)
- **Value Detection**: Frequency of finding +EV opportunities  
- **Backtest Results**: ROI, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown
- **Ready for Live Betting**: Automated alerts and position sizing

## Risk Management from Start

### Conservative Approach
- **Start Small**: Maximum 1% bankroll per bet initially
- **Track Everything**: Every bet, reasoning, outcome
- **Gradual Scaling**: Only increase bet sizes after 100+ bet sample
- **Stop Loss**: Pause strategy if down >10% over 50 bets

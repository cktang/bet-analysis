# âš½ Goal Event Analysis Framework for Value Betting Validation

*Framework to test doubling down vs scalping strategies using goal event data*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **TESTING FRAMEWORK DESIGN**

### **What We Want to Prove/Disprove:**
1. **Do early goals against favorites create value betting opportunities?**
2. **Is doubling down more profitable than scalping in these scenarios?**
3. **How often do "overreactions" actually occur in the market?**
4. **What's the optimal timing for value betting decisions?**

---

## ðŸ“Š **DATA REQUIREMENTS**

### **Goal Event Data Structure Needed:**
```javascript
goalEventData: {
  matchId: "unique_match_identifier",
  homeTeam: "Team Name",
  awayTeam: "Team Name",
  goals: [
    {
      minute: 12,
      team: "home|away", 
      scorer: "Player Name",
      type: "goal|penalty|own_goal",
      gameState: {
        homeScore: 1,
        awayScore: 0,
        minutesRemaining: 78
      }
    }
    // ... more goals
  ],
  finalScore: {
    home: 2,
    away: 1
  },
  asianHandicap: {
    preMatchLine: "-0.5",
    preMatchHomeOdds: 2.0,
    finalResult: "home_covers|away_covers|push"
  }
}
```

### **Analysis Scenarios to Test:**

#### **Scenario 1: Early Goal Against Favorite**
```
Setup: Strong team favored (our strategies identified value)
Event: Opponent scores in minutes 1-20
Question: Does favorite still win AH at higher implied probability?
```

#### **Scenario 2: Early Goal For Favorite**  
```
Setup: Strong team favored
Event: Favorite scores in minutes 1-20  
Question: Does doubling down still make sense vs taking early profit?
```

#### **Scenario 3: Late Goal Impact**
```
Setup: Any of our identified valuable bets
Event: Goals in minutes 70-90
Question: How does timing affect value opportunities?
```

## ðŸ§® **ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY**

### **Step 1: Baseline Performance**
```javascript
// Measure our current strategies WITHOUT considering goal events
function analyzeBaselineStrategy(matches, strategy) {
  return matches
    .filter(match => strategy.selectionCriteria(match))
    .map(match => ({
      matchId: match.id,
      prediction: strategy.prediction(match),
      actualResult: match.result,
      profit: calculateProfit(strategy.prediction, match.result, match.odds),
      goalEvents: match.goals
    }));
}
```

### **Step 2: Goal Event Impact Analysis**
```javascript
function analyzeGoalImpact(baselineResults) {
  return baselineResults.map(result => {
    const earlyGoalsAgainst = result.goalEvents.filter(goal => 
      goal.minute <= 20 && 
      goal.team !== result.prediction.favoredTeam
    );
    
    const earlyGoalsFor = result.goalEvents.filter(goal =>
      goal.minute <= 20 && 
      goal.team === result.prediction.favoredTeam  
    );
    
    return {
      ...result,
      scenarios: {
        earlyGoalAgainst: earlyGoalsAgainst.length > 0,
        earlyGoalFor: earlyGoalsFor.length > 0,
        cleanMatch: earlyGoalsAgainst.length === 0 && earlyGoalsFor.length === 0
      }
    };
  });
}
```

### **Step 3: Simulated Market Reaction**
```javascript
// Estimate how odds would change after early goals
function estimateOddsChange(preMatchOdds, goalEvent, gameContext) {
  const factors = {
    minute: goalEvent.minute,
    scoreDifference: gameContext.homeScore - gameContext.awayScore,
    teamQuality: gameContext.teamStrengthDifference,
    timeRemaining: 90 - goalEvent.minute
  };
  
  // Empirical model based on observed market behavior
  const oddsMultiplier = calculateOddsShift(factors);
  
  return {
    originalOdds: preMatchOdds,
    newEstimatedOdds: preMatchOdds * oddsMultiplier,
    impliedProbabilityChange: (1/preMatchOdds) - (1/(preMatchOdds * oddsMultiplier))
  };
}
```

### **Step 4: Strategy Comparison**
```javascript
function compareStrategies(results) {
  const strategies = {
    baseline: calculateBaselineReturns(results),
    doublingDown: simulateDoublingDown(results),
    scalping: simulateScalping(results),
    hybrid: simulateHybridApproach(results)
  };
  
  return {
    totalReturns: strategies,
    winRates: calculateWinRates(strategies),
    volatility: calculateVolatility(strategies),
    sharpeRatio: calculateSharpeRatio(strategies)
  };
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **SPECIFIC TEST SCENARIOS**

### **Test 1: European Pressure Strategy + Early Goals**
```
Sample: All European Pressure matches (both teams top 6)
Filter: Matches where underdog scored in minutes 1-20
Analysis: 
- How often does favorite still win AH?
- What would doubling down vs scalping return?
- Optimal decision timing?
```

### **Test 2: Away Top 6 Strategy + Goal Events**
```
Sample: All Away Top 6 matches  
Event: Home team scores early (minutes 1-15)
Analysis:
- Does away top 6 team still cover at improved odds?
- Value of increasing position vs protecting profit?
```

### **Test 3: Giant Killing Strategy + Momentum**
```
Sample: All Giant Killing scenarios (home 15+ vs away top 6)
Event: Home team scores first
Analysis:
- How often does giant killing actually succeed?
- When does momentum shift create genuine value?
```

---

## ðŸ“ˆ **EXPECTED FINDINGS**

### **Hypotheses to Test:**

#### **H1: Market Overreaction to Early Goals**
```
Prediction: Early goals against favorites create 15-25% odds movements
Reality Test: Do favorites still win 50%+ of time despite early deficit?
Expected: Yes, creating value betting opportunities
```

#### **H2: Doubling Down Superiority**  
```
Prediction: Doubling down beats scalping when original edge was strong
Reality Test: Compare returns across all goal event scenarios
Expected: Doubling down wins by 20-40% over scalping
```

#### **H3: Timing Matters**
```
Prediction: Earlier goals create more overreaction than later goals
Reality Test: Compare 1-15 min vs 16-30 min vs 31-45 min goal impacts
Expected: Exponential decay of overreaction with time
```

#### **H4: Strategy-Specific Responses**
```
Prediction: Different strategies should respond differently to goal events
Reality Test: European Pressure vs Giant Killing vs Away Top 6 responses
Expected: Strong edge strategies benefit more from doubling down
```

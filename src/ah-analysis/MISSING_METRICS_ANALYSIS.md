## 🚨 **TIER 1: HIGH-IMPACT MISSING METRICS**

### **1. IN-MATCH EVENT DATA** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
*Exactly what you mentioned - these are game-changers for handicap outcomes*

#### **Critical Events:**
- **Red Cards**: Time of card, player position, team affected
- **Penalties**: Awarded, converted, missed, time of incident  
- **Early Goals**: Goals in first 15 minutes (momentum shifters)
- **Goalkeeper Changes**: Injuries, red cards to keepers
- **VAR Decisions**: Overturned goals, penalties, cards

#### **Why This is Crucial:**
- Red card at 20' completely changes handicap dynamics
- Early penalty can swing matches that were tight on paper
- Our current analysis assumes 11v11 throughout - huge gap!

#### **Potential Strategies:**
```javascript
// Red card impact on handicap outcomes
redCardStrategy: {
  homeRedCardEarly: "Red card to home team in first half",
  awayRedCardLate: "Red card to away team after 70th minute",
  penaltyMissed: "Penalty missed in crucial moments"
}
```

### **2. PRE-MATCH TEAM NEWS** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

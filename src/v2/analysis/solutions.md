how is each one works, and whats the pros and cons, do you know our case enough to make 
  good decisions?

⏺ Yes, I understand your case well. Let me break down each approach:

  Your Problem Context:

  - Search space: ~156 factors, combinations grow exponentially (2^156 possible)
  - Expensive evaluation: Each combination requires processing thousands of matches
  - Multiple objectives: ROI, match count, win rate, drawdown
  - Server-side caching: Repeated evaluations are fast
  - Goal: Find profitable, stable strategies with sufficient data

  Optimization Approaches:

  1. Genetic Algorithm

  How it works:
  Generation 1: 50 random combinations [ROI: 5%, 12%, -3%, 8%...]
  Select best 10: [ROI: 12%, 8%, 7%...]
  Crossover: [A,B,C] + [D,E,F] → [A,B,F], [D,E,C]
  Mutate: [A,B,C] → [A,X,C] (random factor swap)
  Repeat 100 generations
  Pros: Explores globally, handles multiple objectives, proven for finance
  Cons: Needs tuning (population size, mutation rate), may get stuck
  Fit for you: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent - handles your multi-objective problem well

  2. Simulated Annealing

  How it works:
  Start: [A,B,C] ROI=5%
  Try: [A,X,C] ROI=7% → Accept (better)
  Try: [A,X,Y] ROI=3% → Maybe accept (worse, but high temp)
  Gradually reduce temp → only accept improvements
  Pros: Simple, escapes local minima, good for continuous problems
  Cons: Single solution path, hard to tune temperature schedule
  Fit for you: ⭐⭐ Poor - betting factors are discrete, not continuous

  3. Greedy + Local Search

  How it works:
  1. Test all single factors → Pick best: [streaking.winStreak] ROI=8%
  2. Try adding each factor → Best: [streaking.winStreak, odds.favorite] ROI=12%
  3. Try adding more → Best 3-factor combo ROI=15%
  4. Stop when no improvement
  Pros: Fast, intuitive, guarantees improvement each step
  Cons: Gets trapped in local optima, may miss global optimum
  Fit for you: ⭐⭐⭐ Good - fast and interpretable, but limited

  4. Bayesian Optimization

  How it works:
  Build model: P(ROI | factors) based on past tests
  Acquisition: "Test [A,B,X] - high uncertainty, might be great"
  Update model with result
  Repeat - focuses on promising unexplored areas
  Pros: Very sample-efficient, learns from history, principled
  Cons: Complex setup, assumes smooth relationships
  Fit for you: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent - you have expensive evaluations

  5. Smart Sampling + Patterns

  How it works:
  1. Test 1000 random combinations
  2. Analyze: "size.dynamic + time.lateseason often good"
  3. Generate new samples biased toward good patterns
  4. Repeat - learn what works
  Pros: Simple, learns domain patterns, interpretable
  Cons: May miss complex interactions
  Fit for you: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect - practical and gives insights

  My Recommendation: Smart Sampling + Pattern Learning

  Why this is best for your case:
  1. Practical: Easy to implement and understand
  2. Efficient: Much faster than exhaustive search
  3. Insightful: Shows which factor types work well together
  4. Leverages your caching: Can quickly test many combinations
  5. Incremental: Can run overnight, stop anytime with good results

  Implementation approach:
  Phase 1: Test 500 random combinations (1-4 factors each)
  Phase 2: Analyze patterns - which categories/factors appear in top performers
  Phase 3: Generate 500 biased samples focusing on good patterns
  Phase 4: Local search around best findings

  Would you like me to implement this smart sampling approach? It's the most practical for
  your betting strategy problem.
